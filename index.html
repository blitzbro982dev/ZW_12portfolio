      <p>Hello, my name is ZW_12, also known as blitzbro982, and I truly appreciate you taking the time to view my portfolio.</p>
      <p>I have over a year of experience in scripting on the Roblox platform and close to three months of commission-based development. While my time in the community may seem relatively short, I take great pride in being an efficient, thoughtful, and detail-oriented developer. I’m constantly learning and improving, and I always aim to deliver clean, reliable, and optimized code for any project I take on.</p>
      <p>Beyond scripting, I also have experience in building within Roblox Studio, particularly in styles that align with Roblox’s visual identity. I enjoy combining functionality with aesthetic quality, and I’m always up for the challenge of balancing both gameplay mechanics and design.</p>
      <p>Whether you're here out of curiosity or considering collaboration, I’d be glad to share more about what I do. Thank you again for visiting — I hope my work speaks for itself, and I look forward to any potential opportunities to connect and create.</p>
